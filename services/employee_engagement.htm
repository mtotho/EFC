			<h2>Employee Engagement</h2>
				<p>The topic of employee engagement is a natural fit with our other topics of business transformation,
				team development and coaching.  Keeping employees engaged is even more important during times of change, and teams are 
				more effective when individual members are engaged.</p>
				<p>Several years ago we were part of a research team that did an in-depth study on employee engagement.  
				We found two organizations, Gallup and The Corporate Leadership Council, who had good data and interesting 
				models for viewing this topic.  The facts are clear, employee engagement is directly correlated to 
				productivity and it impacts a company’s bottom line.</p>
				<p>From our work, we came up with the following definition of employee engagement:</p>
					<p><em>Engagement is the degree to which employees are <strong>satisfied</strong> with their jobs, 
					feel <strong>valued</strong>, and experience <strong>collaboration</strong> and <strong>trust</strong>.  
					Engaged employees will <strong>stay</strong> with the company <strong>longer</strong>, and continually 
					find smarter, more effective ways to <strong>add value</strong> to the organization.  The end result is a 
					high-performing company where people are <strong>flourishing</strong> and <strong>productivity</strong> 
					is increased and sustained.</em></p>
				<p>Here is a helpful visual from The Corporate Leadership Council that brings this to life:</p>

				<p>Examples of our employee engagement work:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Engagement strategy development and leadership training</strong> – Designed and developed an 
					engagement strategy within Johnson and Johnson’s Pharmaceutical Research and Development sector and 
					educated all leaders on how to execute against it.  The focus was on two critical roles that leaders 
					must play to engage employees: <em> 1. Connecting Employees with the Organization, 2. Guiding Employees’ 
					Work and Performance.</em>  We created a menu of tools for leaders to utilize and tracked progress via 
					action planning.  Results:  Improved scores in the employee engagement index of a follow-up employee 
					morale survey.</li>
					<li><strong>Non-monetary rewards and recognition program</strong> – Designed a peer-to-peer recognition program within 
					several organizations.  This included the mechanics on delivery and also training on the “Effective Use 
					of Positive Reinforcement.”  Results:  In all cases, program utilization was very high and employee 
					engagement survey results improved.</li>
					<li><strong>Recognition plan for process improvement initiative</strong> – We described this initiative in our business 
					transformation section:  Honeywell’s Space Systems Division key issue of delivering products on time to 
					their customers.  The recognition plan is worth further elaboration as it relates to employee engagement. 
					 We facilitated the execution of an innovative themed recognition program that included planned 
					 celebrations for each critical milestone.  Results:  Published as a best practice in Performance 
					 Management magazine and recognized in process excellence audit.</li>
				</ul>
