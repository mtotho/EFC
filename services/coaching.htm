			<h2>Coaching</h2>
				<p><em><strong>Coaching is</strong> the process of equipping people with the tools, knowledge, and opportunities 
				they need to develop themselves and become more effective.  The role of the coach is to orchestrate the 
				development process.</em></p>
				<p>Our coaching practices cut across all of our other service offerings.  It is always about bringing out the 
				best in leaders and individual contributors in whatever work we are delivering.  One of our specialties, 
				however, is a formal coaching approach that our clients specifically request for a selected employee.  
				There are many reasons for this work as depicted in the visual below.   In all cases, there is a desired 
				interest in making an investment in the employee’s future.</p>
				<img alt="Coaching Image" src="images/coaching.png" width="600" style="border:2px #965 solid"/>
				<p>We begin our work by forming a partnership with the employee to be coached and his/her manager.  
				This helps to engage all parties in a role to play in the coaching journey.  </p>
				<h4>Here are the steps in our coaching approach:</h4>
				<ol><li>Gaining Commitment</li></ol>
				<ul>
					<li>Coach meets with employee’s manager to explain the process and gain agreement on roles </li>
					<li>Coach meets with employee to explain the process, build a relationship, and gain commitment </li>
					<li>Coach meets with manager and employee together to launch process</li>
				</ul>
				<ol><li value="2">Data Collection and Planning</li></ol>
				<ul>
					<li>Collect data from 360 feedback and self-assessments</li>
					<li>Review current performance documents  (performance reviews, development plans)</li>
					<li>Assess and establish coaching goals and objectives based on data collected and comparison 
					of manager/employee  perspectives</li>
				</ul>
				<ol><li value="3">Coaching</li></ol>
				<ul>
					<li>Hold coaching sessions every two to four weeks</li>
					<li>Identify opportunities to practice new skills and behaviors</li>
					<li>Introduce other learning activities</li>
					<li>Observe employee in normal business interactions</li>
				</ul>
				<ol><li value="4">Follow-Up</li></ol>
				<ul>
					<li>Allow space for employee to practice new skills and behaviors “solo” for 60 days</li>
					<li>Re-assess after interim period to evaluate progress</li>
					<li>Administer 360 instrument one year later to measure success</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>CONFIDENTIALITY is KEY to our success...</h4>
			<p>Eileen Flynn Consulting will not share specific details of any coaching session with managers or others. 
			Update meetings with managers will focus on progress made toward development plan goals only.</p>
