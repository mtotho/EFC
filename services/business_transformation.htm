			<h2>Business Transformation</h2>
			<p><strong>Business transformation</strong> is the fundamental change to the way a business operates, whether 
			that be moving into a new market or operating in a new way.   It is an approach that attempts to align an 
			organization’s activities relating to people, process and technology more closely with its business strategy 
			and vision.  </p>

					<strong>People</strong> - often called &ldquo;Change Management&rdquo;<br />
					<strong>Process</strong> - the identification and ordering of tasks and resources<br />
					<strong>Technology</strong> - the system, equipment, etc.

			<h4>Examples of our business transformation work:</h4> 
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Large system implementation</strong> – Led the Organization and Change Management effort for 
				an SAP implementation for the Supply Chain business in Johnson and Johnson’s Medical Devices and Diagnostics 
				sector.  Focused on areas such as:  organization design, roles and responsibilities, stakeholder management, 
				communications, change impact identification/ mitigation, and training.  Also facilitated the team 
				effectiveness of the overall project team responsible for the implementation.  Results:  engaged 1200 
				end users in a successful go live.</li>
				<li><strong>Process improvement for business execution</strong> – Consulted with the Leadership Team at Honeywell’s Space 
				Systems Division on a key issue of delivering products on time to their customers.  We transformed the way 
				they viewed their operations via an approach that engaged the entire 1400 person population.  This was done 
				with a focus on process improvements in every department, a scorecard that gave constant feedback on progress, 
				support for teams to make it happen, and a recognition plan with celebrations at critical milestones.  
				Results:  on time delivery went from 48&#37; to 100&#37;.</li>
				<li><strong>Workforce planning and downsizing</strong> – The acquisition of the once computer giant, Digital Equipment 
				Corporation (DEC), to Compaq and eventually HP, was executed with sensitivity to their loyal employee base.  
				We took on the serious work of consulting with leaders on their resource needs and then training them on how 
				to manage their teams through the transition.  Dealing with the emotional side of change was a critical 
				skillset that was taught.  Results:  the company went from 120,000 employees to 60,000 and then even further.  
				Many continue to have successful careers within HP.  To this day, you can find a former DEC employee who 
				speaks with fondness about their experience working for the company.</li>
