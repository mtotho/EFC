			<h2>Team Development</h2>
			<p>The need for groups of people to work effectively together as a team is an area of focus for many companies.  
			It is one of the most widely-used methods of meeting deliverables; however, it is not without issues.  Human 
			beings are complex and need structure to come together and become high performing.  Team development is a 
			process and it needs to be managed as such to achieve sustainable results.</p>
			<p>Developing high performing teams is a specialty at <strong>Eileen Flynn Consulting, LLC</strong>.  We have worked with hundreds 
			of teams using a research-based approach.  It all starts with a focus on the fundamentals.</p>

			<h4>Examples of our team development work:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Cross-functional Global Team Development</strong> – Launched over 20 cross-functional drug development 
				teams within Johnson and Johnson’s Pharmaceutical R&amp;D organization.  We utilized the team fundamentals and 
				chartered each team.  We then branched out into Latin America, EMEA and Asia Pacific to connect their teams 
				with the US-based team.  We paid specific attention to the differences in working with Japan, and formed a 
				project team to build effective working relationships across the globe.  Results:  a common language and process 
				was established for all drug development teams that accelerated deliverables.</li>
				<li><strong>Leadership Team Development</strong> – Consulted with Johnson and Johnson’s World-wide Safety and 
				Industrial Hygiene Leadership Team on their strategy and tactics for implementing S&amp;IH around the world.  
				Designed and facilitated off-sites in every region to move this team towards high performance.  Results:  
				improved performance by 32% in one year based on team survey metrics.</li>
				<li><strong>Team Development Consortium</strong> – Established a consortium of HR employees within Johnson and 
				Johnson to teach skills in developing teams.  Created a “train-the-trainer” approach to include a toolkit and 
				real-time shadowing to learn how to work with teams.  Results:  Built team development capability within the 
				organization which allowed for a broader coverage of teams.</li>
