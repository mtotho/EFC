			<h2>Assessments</h2>
			
			
			<h4>Measuring Team Performance</h4>
			
			<p>The use of teams to accomplish business goals is a practice in most companies.  The challenge is to figure out how to put 
			a group of diverse individuals together and have them perform effectively.  As we stated in our 
			<a href="../services/team_development.htm">Team Development</a> section, this is a specialty at Eileen Flynn Consulting.   
			As part of our offerings, we have developed two research-based surveys to provide data to teams on where to focus their attention.  
			This data gives leaders an opportunity to determine a baseline on team performance and then allows for as many follow-up surveys 
			throughout the life of a team to measure progress.</p> 
			<p>Developing high performing teams who deliver results is the goal.  Here is information on our two surveys.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Accelerating Team Performance - Team Survey</strong></p>
			
			<p>This is a robust assessment that targets key fundamentals critical to any team’s success.  See the fundamentals in our 
			<a href="../services/team_development.htm">Team Development</a> section.  Additionally, this survey takes it to an even higher level and 
			addresses research-based drivers that focus on the connections between the team leader, team members and management sponsors 
			from a task and people perspective.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Accelerating Team Performance - Stakeholder Survey</strong></p>
			
			<p>This is an optional survey that complements the team survey.  It contains a small subset of team leader and team member 
			behaviors and practices, and some key outcome measures. It is intended to gather valuable, objective and actionable feedback 
			from a team’s key stakeholders.  Teams can use this additional feedback to compare how they view themselves vs. how their 
			key stakeholders view their performance.  Most importantly, this “outside” perspective helps the team pinpoint “high leverage,”  
			“high impact” team improvement actions.</p> 
			
			<p><strong>What can teams expect when they participate in these surveys?</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A high level analysis of how your team is doing in regard to the fundamentals and drivers that accelerate team performance
				 – what’s working well and what needs to improve</li>
				<li>A detailed report providing the results for each question or survey item</li>
				<li>A facilitated debriefing meeting (optional) to discuss the results and develop improvement actions</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Building Relationships:  Understanding Team Member Styles</h4>
			
			<p>Research studies on team effectiveness continue to point to the link between knowing and understanding team members and 
			team performance.  We have learned that high performing team members seek to understand and value each other.  One way of 
			doing this is through the use of style inventories.  They are helpful in giving individual team members insight into themselves, 
			as well as, learning about one another.</p>

			<p>There are many style inventories available that teams can choose from to gain insight and build relationships. It is strongly 
			suggested that an experienced consultant be utilized to help the team interpret the results and understand the implications for 
			the team.  Eileen Flynn Consulting is experienced and certified, where appropriate, in the following instruments.  We are providing 
			a link to the actual company for further details.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</strong></p>
			
			<p>Widely used and well-researched personality instrument that is used frequently in business settings; examines how individuals 
			relate to the world, gather information, make decisions, and organize themselves.<br />
			<a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org" target="_blank">www.myersbriggs.org</a></p>
			
			<p><strong>Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument</strong></p>
			
			<p>This is the world’s leading thinking style assessment that evaluates and describes the degree of preference individuals have 
			for thinking in each of the four brain quadrants of the HBDI model.  Participants will learn how to communicate with those who 
			think the same and differently from them.  This understanding then opens the door for improved teamwork, leadership, customer 
			relationships, creativity, problem solving, and other aspects of personal and interpersonal development.<br />

			<p><strong>Belbin Team Role Self-Perception Inventory</strong></p>
			
			<p>This behavioral-based inventory aids individuals in identifying their roles on teams.  By identifying team roles, team members 
			can ensure they use their strengths to their advantage and manage their weaknesses as best they can. Sometimes, this means being 
			aware of the pitfalls and making an effort to avoid them.<br />
			<a href="http://www.belbin.com" target="_blank">www.belbin.com</a></p>
			
			<p><strong>DISC Inventory</strong></p>
			
			<p>This instrument measures individuals against four traits:  dominance, influence, steadiness, and compliance.  It focuses on how 
			people approach problems, influence and interact with others, and follow rules and procedures.<br />

			<p><strong>Parker Team Player Survey</strong></p>
			
			<p>The Parker Team Player Survey (PTPS) allows individuals to examine their primary team player style—contributor, collaborator, 
			communicator, or challenger.  The results and related exercises give people insight into how to make the best use of their strengths 
			and develop a plan for addressing their weaknesses.<br />
