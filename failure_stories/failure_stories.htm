			<h2>Failure Stories</h2>
				<p>As the saying goes, we usually learn from our mistakes.  Some of our most motivated clients are those who 
				didn’t pay attention to the “soft stuff” and their deliverables were wrought with overruns in schedule, budget 
				and quality issues.  Worst of all, most companies espouse that “our people are our greatest asset” and we hear 
				over and over again about the retention issues and a disengaged workforce in the aftermath of a big implementation 
				that lacked the people component.</p>	
				<p>Here are some examples of what we found when entering a company to &ldquo;clean up&rdquo; a failed situation.</p>
			<h4>Business Transformation</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>After spending several millions of dollars on a large system implementation, the project was behind schedule, 
					over budget and lacked quality.  Critical team members started leaving.  Trust was eroded as the leadership team 
					members pointed fingers at the &ldquo;other&rdquo; departments who didn’t pull their weight.  Sound familiar?</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>Employee Engagement</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Going hand in hand with business transformation is employee engagement, or the lack thereof, as we have 
					seen in the aftermath of a large organizational change.  The main complaint we heard was around the lack of 
					communications.  Employees were confused about where the company was going and where they fit in.  Their 
					managers were mired in the business details of the transformation and didn’t come up for air to give clear 
					direction and feedback on performance.  Research shows that Generation X and Y employees thrive on feedback 
					and growth.  Many just pick up and go find it elsewhere.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>Team Development</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The stories we have on team development are all very similar.  A typical team in trouble is one that mainly 
					focuses on the task at hand and pay little attention to &ldquo;how&rdquo; they execute.  They struggle with their 
					decision making and their inefficient team meetings.  Their roles and responsibilities aren’t defined so 
					they have false expectations of who is doing what.  This leads to a lack of trust and unmet deliverables.  
					Also connected to this is the misalignment around goals and objectives and how many highly matrixed teams 
					are measured.  We find that teams at first resist doing team development because they think it is about 
					holding hands and singing kumbaya.  When they learn that the intervention IS about the business they begin 
					to embrace it and work on their team issues.  They can then increase their chances for success.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>Coaching</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>They say that people don’t leave companies, they leave bosses. This is very often the
					case when we hear of turnover in an organization. Many complaints we hear pertain to
					specific leaders who drag down entire departments. It often has to do with a style that
					is demotivating and disruptive. Another classic issue is a promotion of a successful
					technical person to a leadership role who lacks skills in leading people. If no recognition
					or investment is made to focus on performance and behaviors, the problem continues and
					productivity on many fronts is impacted. Finding a coach who can provide one-on-one
					guidance to selected employees is one solution to consider. Coaching without a plan and
					clear end date, however, is NOT advised. This is another failure we see over and over
					again. See our <a href="../services/coaching.htm">coaching</a> description under services for an approach that gets results.</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>Still not convinced?</h4>
				<p>One only has to look at the news each day, do a Google search, or read history books to find failure stories 
				that deal with a lack of focus on the people aspects in a given situation.  A case study that is used in many 
				management development classes is that of the <strong>Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986</strong>.</p>
				<p>Here is an excerpt from the case:</p>
				<p>Mulloy, in testimony to a Senate committee, best summarized the circumstances. &ldquo;We at NASA,&rdquo; he 
				said, &ldquo;got into a group-think about this problem. We saw it,we recognized it, we tested it, and we concluded 
				it was an acceptable risk. . . . When we started down that road we were on the road to an accident.&rdquo;  Indeed 
				the teleconference was a classic case of &ldquo;group-think,&rdquo; a form of decision making in which group 
				cohesion overrides serious examination of alternatives. Top level Marshall and Thiokol officials, believing the 
				joint was safe, rationalized bad news from experts, and refused to consider contingency plans. Recognizing 
				consensus among superiors, some subordinate engineers exercised self-censorship. Consequently participants in the 
				teleconference failed to communicate and find useful ways to analyze the risks of cold temperature....Between 7:00 
				and 9:00 the next morning, the ice crew at the Cape inspected the icicle-draped Launch Pad 39B and measured 
				temperature. They recorded temperature of eight degrees near the aft joint of the right solid rocket motor.
				They did not report this finding because it fell outside their directives. At 9:00, the NASA mission management 
				team, which included the Level I, II, and III managers, discussed the ice and decided conditions were safe. 
				No one discussed the O-rings. In Huntsville that morning, Powers told a fellow motor engineer of his fear for 
				Challenger’s astronauts, worrying that &ldquo;these guys don’t have more than a fifty-fifty chance.&rdquo; At 
				11:38, the boosters fired, helping to lift mission 51–L off the pad. In little more than a minute, the aft field 
				joint on the right motor failed and destroyed Challenger.</p>
