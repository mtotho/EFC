			<h2>Eileen Flynn Bio</h2>
			<p><img src="professionalpic.jpg" width="200" alt="Professional Picture of Eileen Flynn" style="float:right; margin-left:10px;"/>
				Eileen Flynn has had a solid career in developing people and organizations, globally, within three large, 
				reputable companies – J&amp;J, Honeywell, and Digital Equipment Corporation &#40;DEC&#41;.  She is now taking her 
				wealth of knowledge and offering practical solutions to individuals, teams and organizations as part 
				of <strong>Eileen Flynn Consulting, LLC.</strong>  Eileen’s extensive career has allowed her to be a &#147;jack of all trades&#148; 
				in the field of organization development.  This helps her to give a holistic recommendation to her clients.  
				She is known as an expert, however, in the areas of 
				<a href="../services/business_transformation.htm">business transformation</a>,

			</p>
			<p>
				Eileen has a core belief that people work best when they feel valued and their strengths 
				are utilized.  Her focus is on &#147;bringing out the best in people&#148; and the power of this approach simply multiplies as 
				the audience increases.   Magic happens as people flourish and deliver extraordinary results.  What is the secret 
				ingredient?  It is Eileen’s passion, energy and experience.  She rolls up her sleeves and puts her skin in the game.  
				She gets to the heart of the issue by asking the right questions and making an accurate diagnosis.  This leads to practical 
				solutions that make sense.

				Eileen instills confidence in her clients by her portfolio of successful applications such as:  leading change, 
				communications and training in an SAP implementation impacting 1200 end users at J&amp;J, developing over 100 process 
				improvement teams leading to 100% on time delivery at Honeywell, and turning around morale at DEC after massive layoffs. 
				It’s never about theory; it’s about real, tried and true methods. Eileen simply customizes to whatever environment she 
				is supporting which allows her to accelerate results for clients.
			</p>
			<p>
				Feedback from clients about Eileen is consistent. She genuinely cares about us.  She understands the connection between 
				people and results and makes things happen. Her energy is contagious.  She doesn’t just tell us what to do; she gets in 
				there and involves us so that we learn and grow. Eileen is invested in our success.  We know she is working with many 
				clients, but when she is with us, we get her undivided attention as if we were her single focus.
			</p>
